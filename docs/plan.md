# API Aggregator MCP Server

This project implements an **API Aggregator MCP Server**—a server that exposes a unified set of tools, each representing a different external API (such as weather, news, finance, or GitHub), through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It is designed for integration with AI agents and LLMs, providing a consistent, secure, and extensible interface for accessing diverse data sources.

---

## Core Features

Core features are essential for a functional, production-ready MCP server. These must be implemented first.

### 1. MCP Server Foundation

**What it does:**  
Sets up the MCP server infrastructure, including the transport layer (HTTP/JSON-RPC 2.0), session management, and basic authentication.  
**How to use:**  
Start the server; it will listen for MCP tool requests from clients (such as LLMs or agentic tools) and route them to the appropriate handler.

**Key Steps:**
- Initialize a Python project with FastAPI (or Flask) and MCP SDK.
- Set up the server to handle MCP requests and responses.
- Implement session management for tracking conversation state.
- Add basic authentication (API keys or OAuth, as appropriate)[1][5].

---

### 2. Tool Definition and Registration

**What it does:**  
Defines each tool (API integration) with a clear name, description, input schema, and handler function. Tools are registered with the MCP server so LLMs can discover and invoke them.

**How to use:**  
Clients can query the server for available tools and invoke them by name, passing the required parameters.

**Example Tool Definition Structure:**

| Element           | Purpose                                       | Example                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Name              | Unique identifier for the tool                | `"get_weather"`                            |
| Description       | Explains what the tool does                   | `"Returns current weather for a location"` |
| Input Schema      | Defines accepted parameters                   | `{ "city": "string", "country": "string" }`|
| Handler Function  | Executes the logic (calls external API, etc.) | Python async function                      |

**Key Steps:**
- Implement a function for each core tool (see below).
- Register each tool with the MCP server, including metadata and input schema[1][2].

### 3. Core Tools (API Integrations)

Each tool connects to an external API, normalizes the response, and returns results in a consistent format. Below are the core tools you must implement:

| Tool Name         | Description                                              | How to Use (Parameters)                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `get_weather`     | Returns current weather for a specified location        | `{ "city": "string", "country": "string" }` |
| `get_news`        | Returns latest news headlines for a given topic or region| `{ "topic": "string", "region": "string" }` |
| `get_stock_price` | Returns the latest stock price for a given symbol       | `{ "symbol": "string" }`                 |

**How to use:**  
Clients (LLMs or agentic tools) call the tool by name, providing the required parameters. The server fetches data from the external API and returns a normalized response.

---

### 4. Unified Error Handling

**What it does:**  
Normalizes errors from different APIs and returns them in a structured JSON-RPC error format.

**How to use:**  
If a tool fails (e.g., invalid parameters, API unavailable), the client receives a clear, structured error message[1][2].

---

### 5. Secure Configuration

**What it does:**  
Manages API keys and secrets using environment variables and secure storage.

**How to use:**  
Store sensitive information in environment variables; the server loads them at startup.

---

### 6. Documentation and Tool Discovery

**What it does:**  
Provides clear documentation for each tool and supports dynamic tool discovery by clients.

**How to use:**  
Clients can query the server for a list of available tools, their descriptions, and input schemas[1][2].

---

## Optional Features

These features enhance usability, performance, and AI-readiness but are not required for the initial launch.

### 1. Caching

**What it does:**  
Caches frequent API responses (using Redis or similar) to improve performance and reduce external API calls.

**How to use:**  
The server automatically returns cached results for repeated requests.

---

### 2. Advanced Authentication (OAuth 2.1 with PKCE)

**What it does:**  
Implements production-grade authentication for secure access to protected APIs[1].

**How to use:**  
Clients authenticate using OAuth flows; tokens are validated by the server.

---

### 3. Streaming Responses

**What it does:**  
Sends incremental, partial results back to clients for long-running operations.

**How to use:**  
Clients receive data as it becomes available, rather than waiting for the full response.

---

### 4. Session Management

**What it does:**  
Tracks conversation state across multiple interactions, enabling more complex workflows.

**How to use:**  
Session IDs are managed by the server and included in client requests.

---

### 5. Dynamic Tool Discovery

**What it does:**  
Allows clients to discover available tools at runtime, supporting more flexible and adaptive AI agents[1].

**How to use:**  
Clients call a discovery endpoint to get the current list of tools, their descriptions, and schemas.

## Example: Tool Definition (Python Pseudocode)

```
# Example tool registration in Python (pseudocode)
mcp_server.register_tool(
    name="get_weather",
    description="Returns current weather for a specified location.",
    input_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "city": {"type": "string"},
            "country": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "required": ["city", "country"]
    },
    handler=get_weather_handler  # async function that calls the weather API
)
```

---

## Usage Overview

1. **Start the MCP server** (e.g., `python main.py`).
2. **Client (AI agent or LLM) connects** to the server and queries available tools.
3. **Client invokes a tool** by name, providing required parameters.
4. **Server processes the request**, calls the external API, normalizes the response, and returns it to the client.
5. **Errors** are returned in a structured, consistent format.

---

## Naming Conventions

- **Project/Server Name:** `api-aggregator-mcp`
- **Core Tool Names:** `get_weather`, `get_news`, `get_stock_price`
- **Optional Tool Example:** `aggregate_dashboard` (returns combined data from multiple APIs)

---

By following this structure, you ensure that the **core features** are implemented first, providing a solid, working foundation for your MCP server. Optional features can be added incrementally to enhance the server’s capabilities and demonstrate advanced skills.
